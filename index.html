            This webpage makes use of the API on (mostly) every browser called the localStorage API. Again, this is on every browser, so you can use it on any computer without having to download anything extra. localStorage uses the browser's cache to store information that remains usable even if you reload the cache or even completely shut down your computer. This is how "cookies" are created. To create one of these fantastic, savable variables, use 
            
            localStorage.~the name of your variable~ = ~whatever you want to store~;
            
            No "var" necessary! to access it, simply use it like a variable and type
            
                    localStorage.~the name of your variable~;

            For example:
            
                    localStorage.lemonDelightScore = 10;
                        ~Reload the page.~
                    alert(localStorage.lemonDelightScore);
                        ~The number 10 appears in an alert.~
                        
            Another awesome part of haviong localStorage is, because it's saved on your browser, not your webpage, you can send that message across webpages, which is helpful if you are making a multi-page game or a page that requires you to have an account.
